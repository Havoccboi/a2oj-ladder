# Does a2oj Ladder really works ?
By Sazzon, history, 3 years ago, In English, [Attach this blog to some contest as a resource]

Hi!

I'm currently trying to improve my problem solving skills to score high here! Recently a friend of mine suggested that I should start solving the a2oj Ladder (which I am!). But I started noticing that most of the problems there are from old rounds and 90% of those are pretty easy. It gets harder along the way or should I try something else ?

    Learn theory
    Do as many as you can problems related to that topic
    Repeat

        After you learn about something search problems in codeforces using tags. For example if you just learned dp do a search like this:
